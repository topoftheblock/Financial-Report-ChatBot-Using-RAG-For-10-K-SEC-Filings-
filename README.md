# Financial Report ChatBot Using RAG

A sophisticated **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system for financial analysis of SEC 10-K reports. By combining Large Language Models, LangChain, and ChromaDB, the system lets users query dense financial filings to extract both qualitative insights (risk factors, business summaries) and quantitative data (revenue tables, operating margins) with high accuracy.

---

## System Architecture

The pipeline is divided into modular components that take data from raw source to an interactive conversational agent.

### 1. Data Ingestion

`src/sec_10k_scraper.py` interfaces with the **SEC EDGAR** database to download raw HTML 10-K filings for specified company tickers and years, storing them in `data/raw/`.

### 2. Parsing & Preprocessing

`src/ingestion/parser.py` converts messy HTML into clean Markdown:

- **Header detection** — identifies SEC-specific section headers (e.g., `PART I`, `Item 1. Business`) and maps them to Markdown headings.
- **Table extraction** — uses BeautifulSoup and Pandas to isolate financial tables, strip formatting artifacts, merge spanning multi-row headers, drop redundant columns, and output clean Markdown tables.

### 3. Chunking & Vectorization

`src/ingestion/chunker.py` processes the parsed Markdown files:

- **Context-aware splitting** — uses LangChain's `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` to keep tables and paragraphs tethered to their section headers, never splitting them arbitrarily.
- **Metadata tagging** — each chunk is tagged with `ticker`, `year`, `document_type`, and `section` before being embedded and stored in a local ChromaDB instance (`chroma_financial_db/`).

### 4. Agent & Tooling

The reasoning engine is a streamlined **LangChain Tool-Calling Agent** (`src/agent/generator.py` and `tools.py`) that autonomously selects from specialized tools to answer each user query:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `semantic_financial_search` | Performs semantic similarity search across texts and Markdown tables. Dynamically applies ChromaDB metadata filters (Ticker, Year) to prevent hallucinating or mixing numbers across different filings. |
| `python_calculator` | Python AST REPL code execution sandbox. Used by the agent to accurately compute percentages, YoY growth, and differences based strictly on the retrieved numbers. |

## How It Works

### The Core Components

#### A. The Reasoning Engine (The "Brain")

At the center is an LLM (like GPT-4o) specifically fine-tuned for function calling. Instead of just generating text, the LLM is given a JSON schema of available tools. When a user asks a question, the LLM pauses, looks at its tools, and decides: *"Do I know the answer, or do I need to trigger a tool to find out?"*

#### B. The Tools (The "Hands")

The agent is completely blind to your financial data until it uses its tools. Two highly specialized tools are provided:

- **`semantic_financial_search`** — This is the RAG pipeline. It takes the agent's semantic query, converts it into a vector, and searches the local ChromaDB. Crucially, it uses metadata filtering (`ticker` and `year`) to ensure the agent doesn't hallucinate or mix up Apple's 2025 data with Boeing's 2024 data.
- **`python_calculator`** — Financial analysis requires exact math. LLMs are notoriously unreliable at arithmetic. By providing a Python AST REPL, the agent can write actual Python code (e.g., `(15000 - 12000) / 12000`) to compute YoY growth or profit margins with 100% accuracy.

#### C. Short-Term Memory (Context)

The agent maintains an active state of the conversation using LangChain's `HumanMessage` and `AIMessage` objects. If a user asks *"What was Apple's revenue?"* and follows up with *"Calculate the growth from last year,"* the agent uses its memory to know that the second question still refers to Apple.

### The Execution Loop

When a user submits a prompt, the agent enters a reasoning loop and will not return a final answer until it is satisfied it has all the necessary data.

**Example prompt:** *"What were Apple's top risk factors in 2025 and how did their revenue grow?"*

1. **Plan** — The agent reads the prompt and identifies it needs two things: qualitative risk data and quantitative revenue data.
2. **Action 1 (Retrieval)** — Calls `semantic_financial_search(query="top risk factors", company_ticker="AAPL", year=2025)`.
3. **Observation 1** — The database returns chunks of text detailing Apple's legal and supply chain risks.
4. **Action 2 (Retrieval)** — Calls `semantic_financial_search(query="revenue figures", company_ticker="AAPL", year=2025)`.
5. **Observation 2** — The database returns a Markdown table showing $390B for 2025 and $383B for 2024.
6. **Action 3 (Calculation)** — The agent calls `python_calculator(query="((390 - 383) / 383) * 100")`.
7. **Observation 3** — The calculator returns `1.82`.
8. **Final Synthesis** — The agent stops calling tools and synthesizes all observations into a polished, natural-language response complete with inline citations as mandated in `prompt.py`.

### Why This Architecture Is Ideal for Financial RAG

- **Zero hallucination arithmetic** — By forcing the LLM to use `python_calculator` for math, the risk of the model guessing numbers is eliminated entirely.
- **Deterministic filtering** — Because `semantic_financial_search` accepts `company_ticker` and `year` as explicit arguments, the LLM natively pre-filters the vector database. A search for Apple will structurally ignore all other filings, ensuring high-fidelity retrieval.
- **Full transparency** — The Streamlit UI exposes the exact internal `Thought → Action → Observation` loop, making it straightforward to debug any incorrect answers.
